WE'RE THEATER KIDS AGIAN

## Time SKIIIIIIP
**A few weeks were skipped and rolls for Study Points were made as well. If you have not done that please do. Also you are all lvl 5 by now too so do that. And you get one proficiency in something you want just make sure it's balanced/run it by me. **

During the skip a few things are investigated and more is learned.

[[Yuki Eradrey]] has become very infamous for finding her way into places on campus that she has no serious business being in. All of her exploration of the school has given her the nickname "Wandering Wonder". Mechanically this gives Yuki the ability to find their way to just about any location on the main campus, even if that area is restricted to other students like upperclassmen or other majors.

On some days, [[Monte Drakonshar]] is a lot more irritable than usual, Maybe he didn't have his morning coffee? Something is bothering him in that brain of his. Monte learns more about Chimeras and consistently asks questions in all of his classes. Some on topic, most crazy. For his Masters of Invention class he has chosen to create a small robotic construct to assist in his studies.

[[Ellis Parker]] has been going over to the House of Arcavios like everyday and spending time with Anzu. In their academics, Ellis has looked into studying the Black Lotus and spends time in garden and Druid spaces, making her a regular and granting him connections. In her studies, Ellis has joined a School Funded Research Study to expand their search into Black Lotus and souls. One more thing has been on his mind though, Ellis is the only member of her family that has magical abilities and doesn't know where they come from. This has been on his mind and he decides to ask her Magic History professor about it.

Anzu has a question for Ellis. "You've been coming over a lot and we've been spending a lot of time together and I was hoping it was leading to something because-" "YES" Ellis interrupts. "I really like you, I just didn't want to mess anything up. I want to go out with you!" "I'd like that a lot" Anzu replies.

## The History of Usirion
Ellis goes to [[Professor Digory Kirke]] and asks him the same question that has been raging in her mind. Where does my magic come from? Professor Kirke sits Ellis down and tells the story of Usirion. Read [[Birth of a Universe]] for the complete story. This does not completely answer Ellis' question but it does give her more information about the world she lives in.

## Merry Morning!
It is the first day of Ever Winter break! 

Yuki came down with a case of Winter Sickness and was not in the beginning of the session. Ever Winter break lasts for one week (ten-day) plus the three day weekend that comes right before it. Exams are 2 weeks after the break ends. 

For the first day the House of Daena group have planned a party/get together with the [[House of Arcavios]]. First thing in the morning, not the best choices were made but day drinking ensues and celebrations happily happen.

Ellis sleeps with Anzu and Monte sleeps on the couch in the common room.

## merry morning...
