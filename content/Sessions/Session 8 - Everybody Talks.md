WE'RE THEATER KIDS AGIAN

## Time SKIIIIIIP
**A few weeks were skipped and rolls for Study Points were made as well. If you have not done that please do. Also you are all lvl 5 by now too so do that. And you get one proficiency in something you want just make sure it's balanced/run it by me. **

During the skip a few things are investigated and more is learned.

[[Yuki Eradrey]] has become very infamous for finding her way into places on campus that she has no serious business being in. All of her exploration of the school has given her the nickname "Wandering Wonder". Mechanically this gives Yuki the ability to find their way to just about any location on the main campus, even if that area is restricted to other students like upperclassmen or other majors.

On some days, [[Monte Drakonshar]] is a lot more irritable than usual, Maybe he didn't have his morning coffee? Something is bothering him in that brain of his. Monte learns more about Chimeras and consistently asks questions in all of his classes. Some on topic, most crazy. For his Masters of Invention class he has chosen to create a small robotic construct to assist in his studies.

[[Ellis Parker]] has been going over to the House of Arcavios like everyday and spending time with Anzu. In their academics, Ellis has looked into studying the Black Lotus and spends time in garden and Druid spaces, making her a regular and granting him connections. In her studies, Ellis has joined a School Funded Research Study to expand their search into Black Lotus and souls. One more thing has been on his mind though, Ellis is the only member of her family that has magical abilities and doesn't know where they come from. This has been on his mind and he decides to ask her Magic History professor about it.

Anzu has a question for Ellis. "You've been coming over a lot and we've been spending a lot of time together and I was hoping it was leading to something because-" "YES" Ellis interrupts. "I really like you, I just didn't want to mess anything up. I want to go out with you!" "I'd like that a lot" Anzu replies.

## The History of Usirion
Ellis goes to [[Professor Digory Kirke]] and asks him the same question that has been raging in her mind. Where does my magic come from? Professor Kirke sits Ellis down and tells the story of Usirion. Read [[Birth of a Universe]] for the complete story. This does not completely answer Ellis' question but it does give her more information about the world she lives in.

## Merry Morning!
It is the first day of Ever Winter break! 

Yuki came down with a case of Winter Sickness and was not in the beginning of the session. Ever Winter break lasts for one week (ten-day) plus the three day weekend that comes right before it. Exams are 2 weeks after the break ends. 

For the first day the House of Daena group have planned a party/get together with the [[House of Arcavios]]. First thing in the morning, not the best choices were made but day drinking ensues and celebrations happily happen.

Ellis sleeps with Anzu and Monte sleeps on the couch in the common room.

## merry morning...
Ellis, being able to handle their alcohol wakes up first to an empty bed. Curious they head downstairs to and empty house and a half awake Monte on the couch. Looking out the windows they can see it is dark outside, opening the door they see that the house they are in has been transported to some type of void or other realm. 

## On the other side
Ellis returns to Anzu's room and uses their magic necklace to communicate with Anzu. 
"Where are you?" "What do you mean? Where are you? You're the one that left."
Ellis has a sinking feeling "Move over to your mirror." As the two walk into frame of the mirror they can see the other on the other side. 

Trying to investigate the strange house Monte investigates Jena's room. Walking in he finds a room that is basically a small library that holds most of Jena's books. Next to her bed is a small side table with an open book and lit candle. Monte puts out the candle. It relights. A page flips. Put it out, relight. Monte searches for a scratch piece of paper and find that he and Jena can communicate through it. He is in different House of Arcavios.

 As Ellis and Monte try to make sense of the situation, they can hear the sound of foot steps coming from the ceiling. Something is on the roof. The foot steps stomp over to the chimney, then loud crashes. Rubble and debris fall through the chimney dust and soot follow. The slamming stops, a red box falls down and lands in the ashes. The box is red with green ribbon, it's wrapped like a gift. 

Ellis and Monte bring it back to the mirror to show the members of Arcavios who have now gathered around the mirror in Anzu's room. Ellis and Anzu are the only ones able to speak back and forth, sound does not travel through mirrors. 

## What's in the box?
As everyone is discussing ideas and theories, Monte has the urge to unwrap the box in view of everyone. The removed wrapping paper reveals a chest. Monte is searching his brain for any idea of what this might be, Jena reaches down and quickly writes on a piece of paper. She pushes forward through the rest of the group to push the paper onto the mirror so that only Ellis and Monte can read the words "library chest?"

Monte moves the chest out of sight of the mirror, Ellis and opens the chest and inside is a very old and think leather bound book that is open with a quill writing inside of it. Reading what the quill is writing reveals that it is narrating someone's actions. The most recent pages are very simple and do not immediately reveal who it is narrating. 

"He sits down"
"He picks up a pencil"
"He "
