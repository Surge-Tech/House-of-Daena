SOME THEATER. SOME ROLL 20

## Festival Kicks off!
The party had a successful first week of school (they all succeed their study checks). They wake up the morning of the first day of the first week festival having breakfast made by Yuki. The festival takes place on the [[Mage Tower]] field but the goal posts have been removed to not be tampered with.

CG - Sixer delivers a pouch of 121 gold to Monte because he is now signed up for the Species Study at Kyokuse and the gold is the refund from tuition and everything. They group finishes breakfast and goes to the bard band kick off event of the festival. After the band performance the bards must have an individual performance and Yuki sings for the party! 10/10. Natural 20! Amazing performance. 

Immediately after Yuki looks for food and has Fire Breath Bacon. The food vender (with a harsh and gravelly voice) cuts her off after one because they are harsh on the vocal cords.

## Lets play some festival games
After discovering that there are activities to do such as ax throwing, casting contests, magic mazes, telekinetic target practice. Ellis and Yuki decide to try ax throwing. While waiting in line Ellis meets a Dragonborn names [[Demetrius]]. Demetrius has trouble understanding and speaking common because his first language is Draconic. The person next to Yuki is a classmate from bard band class named [[Bee]]. Bee is very happy to see Yuki and introduces the party to Demetrius and herself because she is friendly.

Ellis and Demetrius tie the first time and the Game Runner makes it double the prize for them to go again. Demetrius wins but gives his prize to Ellis because its two jugs of mead and he doesn't drink because of his faith. Yuki loses against Bee but only because she slipped.

## Monte buys some magic items
The party sees that the line for the magic maze is long so Yuki holds their spot while Monte and Ellis look at jewelry and magic stuffs. He finds a place called Wizard's Wares & Relics ran my a skinny old man with a long grey beard and a pointy wizard hat named Silverstar. Silverstar has a gravelly voice and falls asleep whenever he stops talking but wakes back up whenever he is spoken to. Silverstar sells mostly raw materials for making your own magic items but has a few finished products such as relaxing stones and alerting stones, they are meant to be put into jewelry such as bracelets, rings or necklaces. Each either relax the wearer or keep the wearer alert for longer periods of time. Monte buys a ring of leaping, ring of underwater maneuverability, and a necklace of forest comprehension. The necklace allows the wearer to understand the animals that live in the forests that the leaves were taken from to make it. Monte asks about the alertness stones but Silverstar, way too sleep deprived can't remember how many of the "yellow ones" (gold coins) they cost so he just gives Monte the one he has on a ring on his finger so that he can catch up on his sleep.

## Jewelry and romance
Monte and Ellis move to the Jewelry booth, Monte is looking for something for Yuki as a thanks for holding their place in line and buys her a Phoenix feather necklace. The vendor, Elara can't tell that it is magic (a real phoenix feather) so she sells it for 1.5 gold. 

Ellis feels a small tap on her shoulder and turns to see [[Anzu Lonelade]]! Monte flirts and Anzu shows him the small matching skull necklace she wants to buy but gets nervous when asked who the other half is for. Outside of the booth Monte and Ellis run into Bee and Demetrius. They learn that Bee, Demetrius, and Anzu live together in the [[World/KIMI/House of Daena/House of Arcavios|House of Arcavios]]. The HoA is on their way to the maze and Ellis wants to join but they realize that the maze groups are limited to 4 people and a minimum of 3. They all go to the maze.

## During the wait... ... ...
Yuki and [[Othello]] are next to each other in line and talk a little but not much. Othello is also in the House of Arcavios.

## MAZE TIME
The party must take up the roles of Surveyor, Bopper, and Investigator. Names to be amended later. The Surveyor must rolls perception checks for upcoming traps and must inform the group so that they don't get caught. The Bopper must hit any oncoming enemies before they reach the party. They Investigator must succeed an investigation check to make sure the group stays on correct path. 

The group gets through everything in the maze with only one mistake putting them in the lead. They see the Arcavios group come out after them but it not nearly as good condition as they were. 

The party is invited back to the House of Arcavios for dinner that night and the party gets to know the students that live there.

## Dinner on the first night
Ellis flirts with Anzu some more and they head up to her room because she is anxious about being in front of everyone. 

Monte gets to know a wizard friend! Her name is [[Jena]] and she wants to know a little more about the library Monte mentioned because her room and an upstairs closet have already been turned into book storage for her. 

Yuki and [[Riggs]] connect over their interest and passion of fire/explosions. Even just mention of the word “explosion” makes everyone duck and look for cover. 

There are other members but one is not here for dinner but no one seems to mind.

## Day 2 Duels!
Yuki is required to participate in the dueling tournament and Monte is a very last minute entry. Yuki defeats Othelo, he takes his loss with grace and is mature. Monte beats [[Lionel]], who is emotional and upset about losing. 

Monte and Yuki face off in the finals but Monte’s spell casting is more advanced and he wins the tournament. Everyone is shocked because they were encouraging him to sign up saying it would be something cool to try but he ends up winning the whole thing!

## Day 3 Closing
The party finds a new restaurant that wasn’t set up on the first day and decides to sit down and have a nice moment. But it’s all ruined when a tour of elementary schoolers come and ransack the place. One student with a snotty nose and sinuses, decides to trouble the group. “Can you do magic? Are you a wizard? What are you eating? Are you gonna kill a dragon?” Very annoying. 

## Grand Feast
The school assembles in the grand hall to have the final feast, marking the end of the first week and the end of the festival. Yuki, too enamored in the food to notice the others wonder around. 

Monte finds Demetrius with a group of people taking notes on his Draconic language, trying to decyoher and learn it. He joins them with his own notes in a collaboration. 

Yuki is approached by Riggs! She quickly gives her a small pouch saying “I thought you might like this!” And runs off. Inside the pouch is a fine powder with a gemstone and a small note reading “You only need a pinch. -Riggs” Yuki removes the gemstone for a closer examination, this immediately changes the color of the powder from black to white. Reading the back of the note “P.S. Don’t take out the gem or else it’ll activate it!” Yuki quickly puts the gemstone back, deactivating the powder once more. 

Ellis, not enjoying the overwhelming noise and people, decides to wonder. On her way out he runs into Anzu, [[Sam]], and Lily. Lily is a friend of Anzu and Sam and they were planning on going back to Arcavios. Ellis joins them and the session ends there.
