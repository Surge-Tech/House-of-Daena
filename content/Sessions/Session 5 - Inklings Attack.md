THEATER OF THE MIND MOMENT
By the way its raining the whole time.

## During the week
[[Monte Drakonshar]] is spending lots of time with [[Jena]] in the [[Hidden Library]] in the house. Jena is impressed but is more relieved to have a place where she can have all of her books and study with someone who relates to her like Monte. It is a very common sight for Jena to be in [[House of Daena]] for hours and with Monte studying in the library.

[[Yuki Eradrey]] spent some time with [[Riggs]], most of their interactions involve Yuki falling unconscious or slightly burned from Riggs' unreliable verbiage and lack of warnings with her experiments. 

[[Anzu Lonelade]] and [[Ellis Parker]] have been spending their free time in the secret garden they discovered last week and go there to be romantic and kiss maybe and hold hands because they like each other. 

## Who wants some?
Anzu tells Ellis about how her belonging and even things she has touched have gone missing from her house and even her room. This is very concerning and Ellis files a statement with the Vice Principal [[Mizette Sharpe]]. After this Ellis plans a stakeout with the rest of her friends.

That night, the first of the weekend, Ellis stays up in Anzu's room while she sleeps. Jena and Monte take the first shift outside of the door as backup. A few hours in, Anzu casts Detect Magic. As they open her eyes they can see Anzu's magic aura surrounding her. A golden lace outlines Anzu's body, as the golden trails flow from her body to the edges of the bed it turns into an inky black color leaving trails to dark corners of the room. Five or six trails lead off and as Ellis focuses their ears in the directions of the inky laces she can hear the gobbling and goobling of the Ink creatures they are waiting for.

## Attack of the goobly inky monters
Ellis messages Jena through the door and she prepares herself and the others. Slowly and carefully they enter Anzu's room. Ellis messages Anzu through their necklaces and she wakes up slowly. After pointing to a few dark corners of the room, the group attacks and tries to capture a creature. The inklings fly up to the ceiling trying to avoid contact and looking for an opportunity to escape. Ellis kills two, Yuki and Jena each capture one. One makes it out of the room and out of the house into the dark, rainy, and windy night. 

## Where's Monte
Monte wakes up, he is in a bright white room with a table and a window. Before he can look outside the door opens and darkness covers the walls of the room, after it, Mizette Sharpe. She immediately speaks "How did you get here?", Monte doesn't know. This goes on for some time. It is revealed that he is in the Staff Housing District. One of the higher floors and below he can see the rest of the Housing District.
Monte is released and is given a Campus Guide to escort you home. When they reach the edge of the Staff Housing, Monte's vision is burred. As if the rain that is falling has covered his eyes and burred it there. He holds the Guide's hand all the way home. 
Ellis hears him enter as though he is drunk, she checks his eyes to find that they seen normal, just orange now. (Monte's eyes are not orange, they are brown). They go to bed.

## Good morning
Nothing really happens. Monte can see again. Let's skip to the afternoon.

## Good afternoon
Nothing really. Monte can still see. Monte is in the library and while looking for answers about loosing vision. Jena is over to help and recommends a book about glasses. Skip!

## Good night
HOLY SHIT STUFF GOES DOWN BACK UP

## Okay, good evening then
Jena has come and gone and come back to bring books over to study with Monte in the library. Monte is in the library and while looking for answers and loses his vision again. He stumbles around in the library while Jena enters in. She finds him and walks him out to watch his eyes change as he begins to go blind. The party is in the House, Yuki cooking maybe, Anzu and Ellis waiting for Jena to come back out. 
Jena sits Monte down on a chair and straightens her glasses to investigate the changing eyes. In slow motion things happen very quickly.

While having detect magic activated, Jena can see dark wisps out of the corner of her eye. She takes her focus off of Monte to Anzu, the golden magic around her is leading out of the front door she left open when bringing in books. A dark, tall and skinny figure steps into the house and grabs Anzu with one of its large hands and starts to walk out. Ellis reacting quickly unleashes blades and shouts that damage the creature but it still walks out with Anzu screaming and struggling. 

Ellis chases it outside but with the thunder and heavy rain he can't track or see it past a certain distance. 

## Tell the staff
Ellis runs off, not waiting for anyone to follow. He makes it to the Staff Building but it is about to close. She talks to the same receptionist as last time. With more conviction Ellis tells her about the kidnapping with a fierce tone and demands President Olvor be notified immediately. 
Cathy, the gnome secretary scrams her paperwork together and away before phoning the president. Ellis begins to breakdown and cry.

Yuki is trying to follow Ellis through the storm but is taking her time because she doesn’t know where she went.

## Low vision, low vision
Monte still can’t see. Jena asks him if he looked through the book she recommended, he didn’t. She walks into the library, grabs it and takes it to Monte. As she opens a page a pair of glasses pop up, as it closes and opens a different page they fold down and different glasses pop up. It’s like a pop up book. They find a pair that works and they two head to the staff building. Monte and Jena share an umbrella. The two navigate their way through the storm and everyone meets at the administration building.

## A literal call to action
The party meets at the admin building, almost too anxious to be waiting. Ellis gets a message from their necklace. In a weak and fading voice he can hear “The garden, I’m in the garden.” 
Ellis springs (literally) up and quickly informs the group before starting her run off to the garden. The party bursts through the double glass doors into the stormy weather, as they are prepared to fight for their friend back!
