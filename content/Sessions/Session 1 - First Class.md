ALL THEATER OF THE MIND

## Let's go to school
Players receive their acceptance letters to the [[Kyokuse Institute for the Magically Inclined]] 

Players received their acceptance letters and were teleported to the entrance of the school and met [[Campus Guides]]. The first CG gives them all a map. This map updates with places that the party explores. 

Players walk up to a CG and then state their names. [[Campus Guides]] seem to always have a hard time recognizing [[Monte Drakonshar]].

Campus Guide - 666666 is the designated CG for the [[House of Daena]] and guided the party around the main parts of the school and to their house in the Housing District. Because all Campus Guides walk very slowly the party decides to pick up theirs and run the rest of the way to their House.

#### Houses
Players move into their rooms and learn that houses are like dorms. Houses are dorms with anywhere from 5-10 people living in one depending on the size on average. Your house is considered your closest friends. Housing is a different part of campus which makes it look like a village with all of the houses. Houses are named after gods or historical figures. Each room is personalized to exactly what they want to match their aesthetic. 

## Walking to class
After moving in CG - 666666 delivers each of the students a small leather pouch with a piece of sigil paper and a scroll of an unfamiliar spell and instructs them to follow it to their "First Class" with Olvor Dodorax. . The players leave after CG - 666666 departs so they use the map to find their way. On the way, they run into Anzu Lonelade. 

#### Rumors Start
Elis Parker is excited to meet new people and runs up to Anzu. Anzu mentions that she is from the House of Arcavios. And how she hears that the House of Daena has a grand library and knows lots of rumors/legends about the school. 

Students are not allowed to visit other houses until school starts.

## First Class
Outside of the classroom there is a deactivated CG holding a sign that says "This one" with an arrow pointing to the door where Olvor Dodorax is hosting today's class. The classroom is circular with the focus on the center-front where Olvor Dodorax is teaching from. Only the four students are in this classroom at the moment because they are the last group of the day. 

#### Summon Familiar
The desks are made of stone and have scorch marks. On the stone slabs there are copper braziers. Olvor instructs the students to place the sigil paper in the center of the brazier and commands a magical phrase. The sigil paper burns into crushed charcoal, incense, and herbs in a neatly placed order. Olvor then instructs the group to cover the brazier and recite the spell on the scroll they received earlier.

Elis is focused on impressing Anzu and their magic is sparkly with rainbows. The ingredients burn bright and the smoke grows tall (Elis slightly burns the tips of their ears), when cleared there lies a [[Frost Fox]].

Yuki first tries to use a BIC (Brimstone Ignition Co.) lighter to ignite the ingredients but Olvor prevents this and assures her that the spell must use her magic to work. Yuki gets a [[Blue-Horned Skewik]].

Monte, thinking too hard, only uses his brain when trying to ignite the ingredients and Olvor gently reminds him that magic uses the whole body, not just the mind. With this new knowledge Monte takes a moment to center himself and casts the spell. Olvor contains the bright and large flame with an invisible containment affect before it consumes Monte (his eyes are closed). The brazier is gone and the stone is pitch black, the soot and marks almost hides the Two-Headed [[Crow]].

Anzu is impressed and has a Thunder Heron

#### Wrapping up
Olvor is happy for everyone, but intrigued by Monte's familiar. He asks to see him in the class' office after cleaning up. The rest of the party walks home.
