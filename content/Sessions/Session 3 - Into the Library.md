ROLL 20 ENCOUNTER

## Into the Library
Reynard goes to bed early, the rest of the party decided to investigate parts of the library. The map from the circulation desk takes time but manages to update the magical map of campus and can be used to navigate the [[Hidden Library]].

Ellis, not knowing what acquisition means, is eager to find the acquisition section. With assistance from the map, also Monte reading it, the party finds their way to the acquisition section. They don't find much, go to the Acquisition Section in the Hidden Library file. From the map on the magical items box they go to the magical items section. 

## Where's the magic?
When they arrive at the magic items section they do not find what they are looking for. Instead, they find themselves in a normal looking room in the library with chalkboards and desks near the entrance, bookcases and tables in the middle, and lecterns at the back.

The party solves the room by placing the correct stories about a Hero, King, Bard, and Wizard on the correct lecterns. Each story is about the same person who rose to power or fame and then used that influence for their own personal gain and motives.

## Beneath the puzzle
When solved, the lectern in the center containing the riddle will sink down revealing a dark spiral staircase.
