ROLL 20 ENCOUNTER

## AQT (A Quick Talk)
Monte has been summoned to a talk with the Olvor, he's not in trouble, Olvor just wants to talk apparently. While Monte and Olvor talk the rest of the party starts to walk home. 

During the meeting, Olvor kindly asks Monte if he has anything he's like to tell him or say to him. Olvor thinks for a moment and offers Monte to opt into the Species Study. Monte accepts the offer. Before leaving, Olvor tells Monte "Remember, we put the same effort into finding what we want as those who want to find us." Pretty cryptic but who minds right?

## The Walk Home
The rest of the players walk home together. Anzu separates shorty after they enter the Housing District to her House. After Anzu leaves Yuki and Elis encounter a tall, shrouded figure that happens to be Reynard! Reynard is assigned to the [[House of Daena]] just like the rest of the party. 

Monte walks home alone but he doesn't mind. The Campus Guide checking student's into the Housing District fritzes when checking Monte's name but lets him in regardless. He is a student after all. 

## The Search for the Hidden Library
Because of what Anzu said to the party on their way to class, Monte has become obsessed with finding the rumored library in their House. Yuki cooks dinner, Reynard watched the mirror (magic tv), and Elis chose to sleep early (just a nap really). Monte counts doors upstairs and downstairs, paces the halls, measures the outside and inside, all multiple times, and begins to get frustrated until he hears a whisper in the back of his head. "Right there! It's right there can't you see it?!" 

These whispers lead Monte to finally be able to notice a door that has been there the whole time, he just chose not to look at it. (there as a perception filter on it so it was hard) Monte now excited rushes to open the door and out comes a flood of [[Book Wurm]]s.

###### BATTLE HAPPENS!
Near the end Elis rushes downstairs and helps finish off the fight.

## Into the forgotten halls
The party is able to defeat the flood of Book Wurms and can step into the dark halls of the [[Hidden Library]]. As they walk in there is an invisible membrane that separates the House from the Library. The heat and moisture from cooking is left behind as the party enters a cool and controlled environment. 

Monte walks in first, no fear, only intent! A reception desk is what he bumps into first and there he can find a few things. 
1. A taxidermy of the book wurms they just fought
2. A locked chest under the desk
3. A letter addressed to the House of Daena
4. Map of a few next door halls 

Monte takes the letter back inside and reads it to everyone.

## Woah a letter!
Whole lotta stuff, dark magic that forced the library to close. The chest holds the dark magic so that it can't escape. The letter is in hopes that someone can restore the library but keep the dark entity out. And it's not signed from what the party can tell.
