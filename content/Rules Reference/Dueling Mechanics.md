Dueling as a sport is separated into two categories at [[Kyokuse Institute for the Magically Inclined]]: Spell Casting and Non-Casting. This document will cover the rules of both and explain the new rules it introduces.

  

### Rules for Duels
**Initiative is re-rolled at the start of every round.**
Negative conditions (e.g., grappled, paralyzed, charmed) will incur disadvantage on initiative rolls. 

Each combatant has 1 **Duel Action** in addition to their usual Action and Bonus Action. Combatants have advantage on ranged spell attacks made from an elevated position. Combatants have disadvantage on melee attacks made against an elevated position.

For safety (in game) an officiant (or team of officiants) will monitor the match to protect the health of the students. An officiant has the authority to deliver match results, grade performance, forfeit participants, and eject spectators, for any reason they see fit.

  

### On your turn

Your turn is separated into *Movement, Action, Bonus Action and Duel Action*. ==The Duel action must be the last thing done on your turn.== You may choose not to use your Duel Action for no consequence.

**Free Action**: Talking and skill checks.

**Movement**: See specific dueling rules.

**Action**: Cast a spell or make an attack, dash or ready an action, disengage, and dodge.

**Bonus Action**: Use a bonus action if available.

**Duel Action**: Shove/Grapple, break a grapple, Offensive Stance, Defensive Stance.

  
### Reactions

Feats, species, or class given reactions are allowed in duels. Readied actions will trigger as a reaction.

### Winning a duel

There are two ways to win, the first is by **resignation** and the second is in **combat**. If your opponent resigns/forfeits the match you win the match (fleeing the arena counts as a forfeit). If your opponent’s HP is 1 or less, you win the match. If the officiant (or team of) forfeits your opponent, you win the match.

### Duel Actions

Each combatant has 1 Duel Action in addition to their usual Action and Bonus Action. Combatants may choose to forfeit their Duel Action for no consequence. **Physically grappling in a non-casting duel is banned.** A duel action can be used to: 

Attempt to **shove or grapple** an enemy (opposed athletics).

Attempt to **break a grapple** (opposed athletics).

Take an **Offensive Stance** (+3 to hit, -2 AC until the end of your next turn).

Take a **Defensive Stance** (+2 AC, -3 to hit until the end of your next turn)

#### Shoving
Is allowed in casting duels and can be used to force an opponent back a circle (1 position).

# Dueling Rules for Spell Casters

The arena for Spell Casting duels is an elevated rectangular area with 7 circles highlighting where a space is. Participants will begin in the first space on their side of the arena. The distance between the center of adjacent spaces is 5ft. Standing on a higher numbered space can give a buff of some sort maybe? I want to add a mechanic here but I can’t think of anything, please help.

**Movement**: You can move up to 1 space forward or backwards. (I think it would be interesting to only be able to move forward while in offensive stance)

**Higher Spaces**: As you move up in spaces you are empowered by the magic within the circles and are able to deal more damage to your opponent but moving closer also causes you to be easier to hit as you get to your opponent. 

(Damage, AC); EX. Starting spot:( 0 ) ( +2, -1 ) ( +4, -2 ) ( +6,-3 ):Middle 

**Overwhelming Pressure**: When moving to a higher numbered space you can choose to make an attack (In offensive stance) as you are pressuring your opponent but with a -3 to your attack roll but you deal an extra die roll to damage.

**Stances**: Combatants may only move forward while taking an offensive stance. Combatants may only move backwards while taking a defensive stance.

# Dueling for Non-Casters

The arena for Non-Casters is a circular I haven’t flushed this part out yet. Participants are allowed items such as weapons(magical and non-magical), shields, armor, magic items, support items. All items must have been made by the combatant or essential for their style or combat.
