*Chronomancy*
 
		A simple spell that has a variety of uses, one such use is looking at past events in time around an object or area the spell is being conducted. 

		The more familiar the user is with the area or object relating to the past event the easier it is for them to reveal.
		
		Dealing with unfamiliar objects or places takes a great deal more of focus and may cause the spell to require more mana, sometimes needing more than one caster or other means of mana generation to conduct the spell.

		Ex. Magic Circles, Mana Generators, Magical Components, etc.

- Chronomancers or other advanced casters who are practiced in this spell are not only able to look into the past of an object but return an object to its past version. Ex. Pages that have been faded or ruined,  Writing that has been smudged or erased, etc.

# WARNING
- **OVEREXERTION** - While conducting this spell there is a high possibility to cause permanent damage to the caster's body if they attempt to push past their limit.
- **MANA LEAK** - While conducting this spell at a high level it outputs a great amount of mana into the environment. This can cause the environment that is not the focus of the spell to change around the caster.
