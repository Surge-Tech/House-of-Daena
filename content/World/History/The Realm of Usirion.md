In the vast tapestry of existence, there are countless realms or planes of existence, each with its own unique characteristics and inhabitants. The realm in which the House of Daena unfolds is known as [[Usirion]], a realm brimming with magic and mystery.

### The Country of Suspaetan
Within Usirion lies the country of [[Suspaetan]], a land teeming with diverse landscapes, bustling cities, and ancient ruins. Suspaetan is a realm of contrasts, where verdant forests give way to windswept plains, and towering mountains loom over sprawling deserts. The people of Suspaetan are as varied as the land itself, with cultures and traditions as rich and diverse as the landscape that surrounds them.

### The City-State of KIMI
Amidst the myriad cities and settlements of Suspaetan, the city-state of KIMI stands as a beacon of knowledge and enlightenment. KIMI, known officially as the [[Kyokuse Institute for the Magically Inclined]], is a renowned university dedicated to the pursuit of wisdom and understanding. Situated at the crossroads of commerce and academia, KIMI attracts scholars, mages, and seekers of knowledge from far and wide. The university operates as an independent entity within Suspaetan, governed by its own laws and regulations, albeit with a respectful adherence to the laws of the land.
