In the mystical realm of the House of Daena, spellcasting is a revered and multifaceted art, encompassing both innate talent and scholarly study. Magic users are divided into two distinct categories: those born with innate magical abilities and those who acquire their powers through rigorous study and discipline.

### Sorcerers
Born with a natural affinity for manipulating the fabric of magic, sorcerers are a rare but revered breed. Their magical prowess often stems from a lineage of magical creatures or divine heritage. Most sorcerers come into their powers during their adult years, with signs of mana manifesting as they mature. Those who recognize their innate abilities early on can seek training at specialized schools and academies to hone their skills and unlock their full potential. Divine "chosen" individuals, guided by the will of their gods, are also considered sorcerers, wielding their powers to carry out divine mandates in the mortal realm.

### Wizards
On the other hand, wizards dedicate their lives to the scholarly pursuit of magic. Through diligent study and practice, they seek to unravel the secrets of the arcane and wield its power through the casting of spells. Attending prestigious wizarding colleges, aspiring wizards engage in rigorous academic pursuits and face fierce competition among their peers. Unlike sorcerers, whose magic flows naturally, wizards must cultivate their connection to the magical matrix through various means, including meditation, extensive study, communion with nature (often favored by druids), and even through the exertion of willpower. Wizards derive satisfaction from the intellectual pursuit of magic, channeling their knowledge and understanding into the casting of spells.

In [[The Realm of Usirion]], spellcasting is both an art and a science, with practitioners of both sorcery and wizardry contributing to the rich tapestry of magical knowledge and tradition. Whether born with innate talents or forged through years of study and dedication, spellcasters play a vital role in shaping the world and its myriad wonders.
