Before the countries, nations and realms you know today, there was one realm with one country with one nation. There, all planes of existence flowed together as one. The plane that is known as the magic matrix flowed through all living things and enabled everyone to use a rudimentary but useful form of magic. With magic being the norm, some of the citizens grew stronger or smarter or more creative, an edge in some type of way compared to the average citizen. We know those individuals today as gods. The god of knowledge we all know as Daena, creativity is I’aná, and so forth. With all the good from these individuals' history, the Ancient Realm entered the Enlightened Age, where creativity and science were explored and encouraged. The creatures of the realm all became smarter with enlightenment from the guidance of the Enlightened Few, a group consisting of Daena, I’aná, and others that thought similarly. 

At the same time, hatred, malice, and anger grew where kindness and compassion grew in others. These like minded creatures formed what was called the Order of Constitution, a sort of what we would call a brotherhood dedicated to the downfall of those who thought that a different way of life was necessary. They believed that there had to be an order to society and magic and that in order to continue living in harmony the creatures of the ancient realm must be controlled, not set free. Individuals we know as Vuhlos and Suiz were members of the Order.

War erupted from both sides, it is unknown how long the war took, some say that the war was made up by people who do not believe in the story, others believe that it took centuries for any one side to gain an advantage considerable enough to be considered. We do know the aftermath, the war split the Ancient Realm into fragments, each containing trace amounts of other realms. That is where other races and species come from, why some magic can be controlled through music while other casters prefer wands or even imbuing items with it. Each style of control comes from a distant ancestor that lived in the Ancient Realm and was split from their realm of origin and lived in Usirion. The individuals who chose sides in the Ancient Realm ascended to Celestia and live in godhood with the powers and strength they gained. Some chose not to become gods, the non-ascenders looked back on what their lives had been and how much damage they have caused and as a form of repentance. Most inhabitants did not survive the Great Split in one piece, most lost their connection to the magic matrix because it was not as easy to connect to anymore. 

Very little else is known from this time because before the Great Split there were no lifespans, everyone was immortal and free to live as they pleased. When the concept of death came around it was a shock to everyone. The only recorded non-ascender went by the name of Suiz, Suiz gave the inhabitants of Usirion a way to remember and document the information that they had never thought to record. Suiz was considered the God of Time but chose to never accept his title as he thought it was overzealous and did not represent his intentions. He only sought to repent for his actions. At the end of Suiz’s life, some still only thought of him as a Member of the Order, others forgave him and remembered all of the good he tried to give back to the newly broken world. Ironically, the magic Suiz gifted to remember has also been lost to time.

This is the creation story that most people believe to be true, others say that life evolved from fish or some shit but that doesn’t make any fucking sense because how could we all have been fish or something at some point?
