Mage Tower is a competitive team sport played by the mage students at [[Kyokuse Institute for the Magically Inclined]]. Anyone can make a team and enter into the open qualifiers tournament. The top 10 teams from the open qualifiers are allowed to compete on the official schoolâ€™s sports teams. Mage students can also try out for existing teams. 


# Rules
- Two opposing teams meet in Strixhaven Stadium. Each team is composed of five mages, plus one small mascot creature.
- Each team has a tall tower at their end of the stadium with their mascot creature at the top.
- The goal is to score points by stealing the opposing team's mascot and transporting it back to your own tower.
- All magic that would harm a player, mascot, or spectator, or that would damage the stadium or basic rules of the game in any way, is nullified.
- Otherwise, all magic is legal, subject to the review of the Mage Tower Referee Council.
- The game lasts for three phases. Each phase lasts as long as it takes for the Mage Tower hourglass to empty, which is approximately 20 minutes. (Sometimes the last few grains of sand in the hourglass take their sweet time to roll around and drop to the bottom.)
- When time is called at the end of the third phase, the team with the most points wins.
