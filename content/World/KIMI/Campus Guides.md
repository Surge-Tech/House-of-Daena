Little GUYS!
# Description
Campus guides are mechanical constructs at [[Kyokuse Institute for the Magically Inclined]] that guide, escort, and help students in any way they know how.  The blue membrane is a portal to a large storage room for them to store maps, maps, and sometimes snacks and gifts from grateful students. 

It is rare for a campus guide to need it's own maps as they have a gift for finding things on campus and often popping up at the most inopportune times.
