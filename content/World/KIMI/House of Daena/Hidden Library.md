The [[House of Daena]] has a secret, hidden library. Because each House is named after someone/thing, it makes sense for a super cool library to be in the Goddess of Knowledge's House right? Right?

It appears to be similar to a normal library, just HUGE. The Library has many sections and lots of books, most you never heard of because there's so many. 

The different sections include but not limited to:
* Fiction
* History
* Reference
* Acquisition
* Periodical
* Catalogue
* Circulation (Entrance)
* Maintenance
* Magic Items

### Acquisition
A one room section with tables and ballot boxes on top labeled with each section. This room is meant to be where suggestions and recommendations for the library to acquire.

If a slip of paper with title and author of a book is written on it and placed in the appropriate box, the library will attempt to acquire it. If the item is already in the library it will highlight the map on the box and write the book's code (section, floor, bookcase, shelf, position) on the back of the slip of paper. If the book is check out then the box will write "Checked out" on the back instead.

### Magic Items
The magic items section of the library is protected by a puzzle room above it. The puzzle room requires certain books to be placed on the 8 podiums at the end of the room. When done correctly the lectern in between the 8 will sink down revealing the magic items department.
