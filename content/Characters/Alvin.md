Magic Item Concierge in the Magic Items section of the [[Hidden Library]]. Alvin is knowledgeable in magic items and is willing to help the party any way he can. His knowledge of the party comes from his connection to the school’s information which is why he is able to recognize them once they state their names. 

Even though the library has lots of rooms and corridors, Alvin seems to be the only “living” thing in the library. No people or other constructs.
