Special little guy
Sixer is a [[Campus Guides]] at [[Kyokuse Institute for the Magically Inclined]]. 

Given a flower as a gift by [[Ellis Parker]]. Campus Guide - 666666 accepts gifts from the party but does not know how gift giving works. It assumes that what is given is meant to be stored in it's pocket dimension and will put just about anything in there. And when it hears that the party likes something or is interested in something it will pull out something it thinks they will like. 
For example, it was tea time at the end of [[Session 3]] and Sixer gave them some slightly stale tea biscuits.
