### Backstory
Yuki Eredray comes from a small peaceful village called O'ranthas. The elves of O'ranthas live neighborly and in peace with their surroundings. As the greater majority of the world outgrew the old ways of living, the elves of O'ranthas found comfort in their cemented traditions. Don’t ask for any examples, I didn’t think of any. At the center of their traditions is the Amulet of Saraswati. An ancient amulet with a green gem hung by a golden chain. The powers of the amulet are forgotten in the traditions of O'ranthas, but the devotion lives on in the songs, dance, and festivities that surround it.

Yuki, a young elf living in the town of O'ranthas lived her life peacefully just like the rest of her town. As a young elf growing up in O'ranthas, Yuki was always drawn to the mesmerizing flames of the village's hearth. Fascinated by the dance of fire, she would spend hours practicing her own form of fire magic, manipulating the flames with delicate movements of her hands. One evening, during a festival celebrating the summer solstice, Yuki astonished her fellow villagers with a dazzling display of fire dancing, twirling and weaving intricate patterns of flame to the rhythm of her flute. From that moment on, she became known as the Fire Dancer of O'ranthas, admired for her mastery of both music and magic.

Unfortunately, tragedy struck the town of O'ranthas. The town and its citizens were massacred and executed by a demonic force searching for the Amulet of Saraswati. Yuki rushed to the elders’ houses and stole the amulet to keep it safe. 

Alone and traumatized, Yuki wandered aimlessly through the wilderness, her heart heavy with grief and rage. She blamed herself for not being able to protect her loved ones, haunted by the feeling of helplessness that consumed her during the attack. As days turned into weeks, Yuki struggled to find purpose in her shattered world, grappling with survivor's guilt and the weight of her loss. Until. Until the day a letter, stuck to a tree by an arrow, addressed to Yuki from the Kyokuse Institute for the Magically Inclined.
