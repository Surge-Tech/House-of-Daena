### Backstory

Born to a family known to have magical prodigies throughout my line of ancestors, my magical power was expected to be high and hopefully to the same degree as my ancestors before me. However as I grew older my magic seemed to be average at best, sometimes below that for certain magics. I was seen as a disappointment or a let down by some in my family, even if some did not say it directly I noticed. I had friends in school but they usually stayed that way, when out of school I was usually on my own trying to work on my magic or find out if there was anything I was good at. During a break from school I decided to go out and explore on my own on the land surrounding our property, when I stumbled into the ruins of a building hidden by overgrown vines and trees. In it I found a pathway leading underground to an old and weathered area of what seemed to be a personal library or study. While exploring this area I found a book that was strangely in perfect condition. The book was locked but conveniently after struggling to find a way to open it, I found a key on the nearby table that fit perfectly. After unlocking the book and proceeding to open it, a rush of heat filled my body and a bright flash of white blinded me, then nothing but black. When I came to, I was on the floor of the ruined building, book in hand. I stashed it in my bag and returned home not telling anyone what happened there. Since then I have been performing in my magical studies a lot better than before and things are coming more naturally to me than it did before. I don’t know what this book I found exactly is but it is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I am now set to go to a top notch school of magic, hopefully this newly found gift will help me show everyone that I’m not the disappointment they thought I was.

### Fears

He is afraid of losing his magic potential or ability (since gaining this new power), he feels if he goes back to what he was before the book then everyone will forget about him and he will be pushed to the sideline like when he was younger and weaker.
