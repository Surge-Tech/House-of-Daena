# The House of Daena D&D Campagin

> “The unfortunate fact of life is, dying for what you believe in, doesn't make it true.”

The House of Daena is a Dungeons and Dragons campaign set in the homebrew world of Usirion.
This respository is a collection of notes hosted online using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) and GitHub pages.

All notes are in the [content](https://github.com/Surge-Tech/House-of-Daena/tree/v4/content) folder but to see the them in their full glory visit the website at houseofdaena.com.

Notes are updated basically whenever I am free and motivated enough to write it all out.
